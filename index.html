                PlanMyFood is suchhhhhh a great platform. So informative. For a
                layman who doesnâ€™t have much knowledge about processed foods and
                whatâ€™s being sold in the market claiming it as â€˜healthyâ€™, a
                platform like this is surely an eye opener. I have started
                reading labels carefully and checking stuff on the PlanMyFood
                App before buying or consuming anything processed. Such a great
                initiative, and a must have application for everyone. Kudos to
                you and your team.

                I love the PlanMyFood app. As a nutritionist it is very
                empowering as it makes my work so much easier. As a user it has
                made understanding products so much easier. You just scan a
                product's bar code and you get to know all the details regarding
                the product, be it ingredients or nutritional value and the app
                also helps you by rating it as per your health goals and current
                profile. It is so easy for us to create a list of the food we
                have to shop for the month or find substitutes of a particular
                product. An incredibly useful feature of the app is the recipes
                it has. It is so much easier for me to search for good and
                healthy recipes and look through them all at one place, no
                browsing for them at different places anymore! Thank you to the

                My son is gluten intolerant â€¦ with PMF I can shop worry free! It
                has made life easier . PlanMyFood has become my most important
                companion in my lifestyle and Iâ€™m happy I have this app on my
                phone. PMF is designed to make you more fit, more importantly
                more healthy. When u scan a product , the app matches it to your
                personal profile and tells you how beneficial it is for you or
                not. Not only that, the whole nutritional detail of the product
                flashes ... and you can decide whether you want it or not.

                PlanMyFood is an incredible app. No matter what your goal, PMF
                will always give you the healthier, better option.Thereâ€™s so
                much information at the tips of your fingers, and itâ€™s all
                customised for each individual. The inventory database has got
                so many products I didnâ€™t know were available! And the best part
                is, it tells you where to get it from.

                feel more energetic throughout the day and I'm able to hit the
                gym even after my football training session. Now itâ€™s almost
                like having a food nutritionist right here with me. PlanMyFood
                made me realise that healthy can be tasty too. PlanMyFood has
                also helped me pick out best products for me while grocery
                shopping.

                Thank you PMF for simplifying health. PMF to me is a
                revolutionary approach to attaining the right nutrition goals as
                per the individual on your finger tips. Not only does it guide
                you towards a healthy body it delves deeper into the actual
                product suitable for your body type not shifting its focus from
                the individualâ€™s ultimate objective. Just a scan of a barcode of
                the product sheds light on whether itâ€™s right for you. It
                doesnâ€™t just stop there, it recommends other products you can
                swap with if the one in question doesnâ€™t quite fit. Itâ€™s
                fantastic and essential.

                PMF empowered me to get back to a healthy diet routine with its

                It's much easier pressing a button and having all the best
                alternatives than scanning nutrition labels and supermarkets for
                better alternatives. Living an on the go life, it's tough to
                plan all your meals of the day. Too many decisions to make
                coupled with what sources of information to trust makes it an
                impossible task to stay consistent to your health goals. Hunger
                bouts usually lead to chewing on the nearest piece of food
                without a thought of what that does to my body. Using PMF has
                made me aware of the potential pitfalls that such decisions can
                have in my life. PMF has by all means empowered me to take sound
                health decisions consistently. Avoiding the loss by junk food is
                one benefit, PMF helped me figure out how to make every meal
                perfect for my goals by showing the best alternatives available
                for the unhealthy foods.

                Being gluten intolerant for 8 years, PMF has quite literally
                made my life easier. It used to be genuinely cumbersome reading
                every ingredient in anything I bought. Now, however, I just have
                to point my phone at whatever appeals to me to find out whether
                it contains gluten. Not to mention the fact that the app aided
                me in improving my diet and in making healthier choices!

                PMF has been an absolute game-changer in my daily food
                consumption. In the day and age of false marketing by FMCG
                companies, the technology that PMF provides is imperative to
                what i believe is consumption literacy. I have completely
                abandoned products which do not match my goals, and it is
                shocking to learn about the amount of artificial substances
                included in 'natural and healthy' products like juices and jams.
                What i like most is the complete set of customised offerings of
                PMF including recipes, diets, workouts and recommended tradeups
                which I can blindly follow now for my health!

                Wonderful nouveau app, to get ratings of food you are actually
                intaking. Guides you perfectly as to what to eat/use and what
                not to use based on your inputted health parameters. Had been
                eating a lot of unwanted/ unhealthy food items thinking them to
                be healthy based on marketing promotions and celeb brand
                endorsements, only to realize ( thanks to pmf) that it was just
                a gimmick and not actually healthy food as pmf decoded their
                actual ratings for me. Glad such a unique n easy to understand
                system has been developed by pmf to let us choose our food
                correctly and aptly. Kudos appreciate it.

                PlanMyFood is suchhhhhh a great platform. So informative. For a
                layman who doesnâ€™t have much knowledge about processed foods and
                whatâ€™s being sold in the market claiming it as â€˜healthyâ€™, a
                platform like this is surely an eye opener. I have started
                reading labels carefully and checking stuff on the PlanMyFood
                App before buying or consuming anything processed. Such a great
                initiative, and a must have application for everyone. Kudos to
                you and your team.

                I love the PlanMyFood app. As a nutritionist it is very
                empowering as it makes my work so much easier. As a user it has
                made understanding products so much easier. You just scan a
                product's bar code and you get to know all the details regarding
                the product, be it ingredients or nutritional value and the app
                also helps you by rating it as per your health goals and current
                profile. It is so easy for us to create a list of the food we
                have to shop for the month or find substitutes of a particular
                product. An incredibly useful feature of the app is the recipes
                it has. It is so much easier for me to search for good and
                healthy recipes and look through them all at one place, no
                browsing for them at different places anymore! Thank you to the
                PMF team for creating such a genius app:)

                personal profile and tells you how beneficial it is for you or
                not. Not only that, the whole nutritional detail of the product
                flashes ... and you can decide whether you want it or not.

                Thank you PMF for simplifying health. PMF to me is a
                revolutionary approach to attaining the right nutrition goals as
                per the individual on your finger tips. Not only does it guide
                you towards a healthy body it delves deeper into the actual
                product suitable for your body type not shifting its focus from
                the individualâ€™s ultimate objective. Just a scan of a barcode of
                the product sheds light on whether itâ€™s right for you. It
                doesnâ€™t just stop there, it recommends other products you can
                swap with if the one in question doesnâ€™t quite fit. Itâ€™s
                fantastic and essential.

                It's much easier pressing a button and having all the best
                alternatives than scanning nutrition labels and supermarkets for
                better alternatives. Living an on the go life, it's tough to
                plan all your meals of the day. Too many decisions to make
                coupled with what sources of information to trust makes it an
                impossible task to stay consistent to your health goals. Hunger
                bouts usually lead to chewing on the nearest piece of food
                without a thought of what that does to my body. Using PMF has
                made me aware of the potential pitfalls that such decisions can
                have in my life. PMF has by all means empowered me to take sound
                health decisions consistently. Avoiding the loss by junk food is
                one benefit, PMF helped me figure out how to make every meal
                perfect for my goals by showing the best alternatives available
                for the unhealthy foods.

                PMF has been an absolute game-changer in my daily food
                consumption. In the day and age of false marketing by FMCG
                companies, the technology that PMF provides is imperative to
                what i believe is consumption literacy. I have completely
                abandoned products which do not match my goals, and it is
                shocking to learn about the amount of artificial substances
                included in 'natural and healthy' products like juices and jams.

                Wonderful nouveau app, to get ratings of food you are actually
                intaking. Guides you perfectly as to what to eat/use and what
                not to use based on your inputted health parameters. Had been
                eating a lot of unwanted/ unhealthy food items thinking them to
                be healthy based on marketing promotions and celeb brand
                endorsements, only to realize ( thanks to pmf) that it was just
                a gimmick and not actually healthy food as pmf decoded their
                actual ratings for me. Glad such a unique n easy to understand
                system has been developed by pmf to let us choose our food
                correctly and aptly. Kudos appreciate it.
